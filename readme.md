# JSON translation tool

Client-side static page that acts as a tool to translate JSON files with texts in other languages through a simple editor. There are two version: the recommended one uses the new experimental File System Access API ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/native-filesystem-api)) while the second simply uses an input file (with webkitfolder).

## Expected file structure

The tool opens a folder project that contains:

- a `manifest.json` file which specifies the languages of the projects
- any number of subfolders containing `<locale-code>.json` files

## manifest.json

The manifest inside a folder project specifies the language of reference and all the "foreign" ones. For each of them, the locale code and name must be provided. The `./<subfolder>/<reference.code>.json` file is taken as reference texts (and won't be changed in the file system access version). Example:

```json
{
    "reference": {
        "code": "en",
        "name": "English"
    },
    "foreign": [
        {
            "code": "it",
            "name": "Italiano"
        },
        {
            "code": "fr",
            "name": "Fran√ßais"
        }
    ]
}
```

## \<locale-code\>.json

JSON files containing the texts is an object `A` whose values can be either strings or other objects `A`. Each object `A` defines an increasing nesting in the editor. An example of a possible structure is the following:

```json
{
    "title": "Welcome back!",
    "profile": {
        "see": "See your profile",
        "edit": "Edit your profile",
        "posts": "Your posts"
    },
    "aboutus": {
        "title": "About us",
        "description": "lorem ipsum ...",
        "geo": {
            "nation": "United Kingdom",
            "city": "London"
        }
    }
}
```
